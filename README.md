# Crustacean
Repository to hold code for Crustacean Game Engine. Creatred by Chris Fischer and Paolo Hidalgo.
## About Crustacean  
Crustacean is a game engine written in Java that uses Vulkan for rendering. This project was created to because we wanted to make a game engine and we wanted to try out Java programming with modern features such as ZGC, Panama, and hopefully soon Valhalla. This repo is very unorganized and still contains code from when the engine used OpenGL for rendering.  
## Plams  
Our plans for this project going forward:
- Get JNewton bindings working in engine
- Implement indirect rendering pipeline
- Implement portals
