# Crustacean
Crustacean Game Engine Repository. Created and developed by Chris Fischer and Paolo Hidalgo.
## About Crustacean  
Crustacean is a game engine written in Java that uses the Vulkan rendering API. This project was created to because we wanted to make a game engine and we wanted to try out Java programming with modern features such as ZGC, Panama, and hopefully soon Valhalla.  
## Plans  
##### Our plans for this project going forward:
We would like to continue improving the performance of the engine as we learn better techniques for rendering. As well as performance we would like to produce a packagable engine that works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS and contains all relevant jars and dlls to run.
